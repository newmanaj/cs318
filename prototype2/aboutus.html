      About Us
    </h1>

    <div class="line"></div>
   <p>
 Gary Brunclik has over 49 years of experience in the construction industry. He began as an accountant with a plumbing and heating contractor in Osceola. Over his years with the company, Gary continued his education becoming a licensed soil tester, and finally spent eight years working on outside sales and design of plumbing, heating, air conditioning and electrical systems. 
</p>
<p>
    For the past 30 years Gary has been involved in general contracting and land development. In the beginning he did much of the labor himself on each aspect of the construction. Today the business has developed into a strong network of dependable local subcontractors. The use of local subcontractors is part of our commitment to the community and you to help ensure local service for the products in your home. Gary's goals are to provide an excellent quality product for a fair price and to offer a home that you will be proud to own.
