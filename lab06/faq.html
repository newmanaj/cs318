    <h3> How can I find out about Girl Scout camps in my area? </h3>
    <p class="answer"> Call your local Girl Scout council and ask for a copy of the day or resident camp information. If you want to attend a camp program and your council doesn't offer one, ask for the name of another council in the area or look up the councils in your state. Most councils allow participants from other areas to attend their camps.</p>
   
    <h3> In what grade does a girl have to be to start camping? </h3>
    <p class="answer"> There is no set age for camping, just a need for individual and troop/group readiness for the experience. Before going into an unknown situation, girls should feel comfortable staying away from home one or two nights. Try a sleepover first. If a girl has never been to camp before, she should spend some time learning skills needed in an outdoor environment. </p>

    <h3> How old do girls have to be to go out hiking? </h3>
    <p class="answer"> Girls can hike whenever they feel ready. It's similar to taking a walk, going by foot to the local store for milk, or going from shop to shop at the mall. A hike is a longer walk, with a purposeâ€”whether following a trail you have selected or reaching a special destination. A hike is planned with your troop/group, supervised by adults, and a group first-aid kit is carried by the first-aider. Longer hikes usually involve daypacks with lunch or snacks, water, and rain gear. A hike might be a mile or two in a nearby park or at a camp, or five or six miles in a state park. Start out with shorter hikes and build up to longer hikes.</p>
