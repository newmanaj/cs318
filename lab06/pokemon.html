        <p>Pikachu encountered Mew one day while playing with his friends Piplup, Charmander, and Chikorita. Mew led them to a mysterious hole which transported them all to the PokéPark.

Mew explained that the PokéPark was in danger, that the Sky Prism had shattered and only one that knew true friendship could restore it. If he failed, the Sky Pavilion would crash into the PokéPark. Pikachu comes to, and is greeted by a friendly Chatot who then guides him to the Meadow Zone where he finds Chikorita. After taking part in an Attraction, a Treecko and Mankey take Chikorita to the Zone leader, Venusaur. Pikachu follows them and is promised Chikorita's freedom if he can complete Venusaur's Attraction. With Chikorita rescued, the pair travel to the Meeting Place where Chikorita decides to construct their headquarters while Pikachu searches for Shards </p>
